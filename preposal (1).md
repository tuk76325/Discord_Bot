# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Currently my number 1 idea is to create a discord bot that mainly functions as a magic 8 ball, which can serve to end arguments or answer questions when a user inputs a command. 

For a second idea, I want to do something related to bioinformatics, as  that is the career I plan to pursue after college. However, I am having trouble coming up with an idea that would be achievable and original. I have done some basic research on Biopython (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/biopython/index.htm), but everything in this package seems like tools for analyzing something you already know you want to analyze. To be honest, it all seems above me and I am not sure if I can successfully make a project out of it.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No collaboration

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Nope
