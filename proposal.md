# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Magic 8 Ball Discord Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This discord bot will give an answer akin to a magic 8 ball when prompted with a command in discord.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will begin by researching the common answers a magic 8 ball usually gives. To follow this, the probability for each answer will be determined by taking 1/(total number of possible answers). The software itself will answer when prompted with a command in a discord server that has the bot as a member. Furthermore, this bot will only respond when prompted by a certain character (!, -, ., this is to be determined). 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

An outcome I wish to accomplish no matter what is correctly coding a discord bot that can join and message in a discord server. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome will be that this bot can have a set response when the message it sends is reacted with a certain emote.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for this bot is that it works correctly, and it can be used to end arguments or create funny situations.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Firstly, I will need to figure out how to create a bot that can join as a memeber to a discord server. I will need to research how to add a bot into a discord server, as well as having it be able to read messages when they begin with a certain character. In addition to this, I will need to research every possible outcome that a magic 8 ball can produce, and the probability that they show up. I will also need to research how a discord bot can take a reaction as an input.
