# FinalProjectCIS1051

This project utilized the Discord API to manufacture a bot that could interpret and respond to select messages in a server. 

This project was the culmination of everything I learned in the CIS1051 Python Programming class. Throughout this project, I was constantly learning new things. One of the most important and universal things I learned was the use of pip installing the API necessary for Discord, furthermore, this project taught me how to effectively consult and apply documentation for an unknown API. I also gained a greater appreciation on the coding aspect for how automated bots read and receive messages. Finally, I learned how the client side of bots work, with their ability to be run on a local server, how much computing power they use, and how much memory they consume.
