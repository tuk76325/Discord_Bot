# FinalProjectCIS1051
This is the final project.

Everything said in this file will be conveyed in the YouTube video, so if you do not like reading you can watch the video.

Throughout this project, I was constantly learning new things. One of the most important and universal things I learned was the use of "pip" installing the API necessary for Discord. One of the more specific things I learned was the use of @client.event to start a block of code for Discord bots. With that being said, I also struggled at some points in this project, with one of them being the use of a coro (coroutine) in the execution of my code. At first I had no idea what a coroutine was, and how it was used in the coding process, but after about an hour or so of digging around my references and the Discord FAQ, I realized that I didn't need the coroutine at all! So it took a while, but I eventually got over that hurdle.
