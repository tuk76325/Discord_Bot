Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far for my project I have outlined the steps I need to take in order to complete the project, and I have done research on the type of code I will need to implement in order to make the bot a user on Discord. Furthermore, I have created the server so that I can test and use the bot. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to code a majority of the bot, however I plan to do this over the course of break as I will finally have time away from my other major courses. With that being said, the outline I have has definitely helped keep me organized, and has provided the framework I will use to actually inject the correct coding.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

As of now, I have not encountered any problems, however I expect that to change as I begin coding.
